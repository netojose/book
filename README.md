## Important information

I had no time to implement the change the bars scaling feature (but I did the change precision column, and this is basically has the same complexity). About the bar, I also didn't set the bar width, because [the documentation](https://docs.bitfinex.com/reference/ws-public-books#book-entry) is not clear about the values is used to set the bar width.
About the table, I filled the bids (left area), but the ask side (right side), I couldn't because once again, the API is not clear about what the values are from the left (greeen), and what the values are from the right (left).

I also hadn't time to implement connect/disconnec connection buttons, handle socket reconnection, install lint rules, implement unit tests, etc.

I sent an email asking about the questions above (as recomendend by the challenge instructions), but I didn't have the support.

If I have more time, and the answers for the missing information, I can finish 100% of the challenge, but I believe the finished pars are more complex than missing parts and can demonstrate I can the do the rest.

> PS.: I sent all my challenge code before the time limit, but I'm sending more one commit jsut with these README.md changes to explain the missing points.
